# ISP-CHURN-PREDICTION
#Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer data for a regional Internet Service Provider (ISP) to identify key factors contributing to customer churn. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques, we develop a predictive model to accurately classify customers likely to churn. This helps the company implement targeted retention strategies and reduce customer turnover.

#Dataset

The dataset contains customer information, service usage details, billing information, and demographic attributes collected from the ISPâ€™s customer base. It includes both categorical and numerical features relevant to churn behavior.

#Objectives

Understand the patterns and factors influencing customer churn through detailed EDA.

Prepare and preprocess data for modeling (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).

Build and evaluate classification models to predict churn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Identify important features contributing to churn.

Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

#Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

#Project Workflow

Data Understanding & Cleaning: Explored dataset for missing values, anomalies, and data types. Cleaned and transformed data accordingly.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized feature distributions, relationships, and churn patterns.

Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables, scaled features, and created new features where relevant.

Modeling: Split data into training and test sets; trained multiple classification models.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Feature Importance: Analyzed and reported top predictors of churn.

Conclusion & Recommendations: Summarized findings and suggested strategies for churn reduction.
